# CaregiverSensitivityClassifier
This repository contains the code for the real-world binary caregiver sensitivity classification model, developed for audio data collected using LENA devices. The model is described in detail in our [paper]()(In Submission).

Given raw audio recordings of infant distress episodes, along with distress annotations and LENA-derived adult speech tags, the pipeline extracts relevant features and predicts the caregiverâ€™s sensitivity level (_High_ vs _Low_) for each episode.

If you use this code or model in your work, please cite our paper (see below).
