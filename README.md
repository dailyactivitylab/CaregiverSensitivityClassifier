# CaregiverSensitivityClassifier
This repository contains the code to run the real-world binary caregiver sensitivity model for audio collected using LENA, as described in this [paper]()(In Submission). Given the raw audio of infant distress episodes along with distress/non-distress labels and LENA adult speech tags, the code extracts the required features and the model predicts a caregiver sensitivity level (_High_ vs _Low_) for each distress episode. If you use the model or code, please cite the following paper.
